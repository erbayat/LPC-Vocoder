# LPC-Vocoder-
Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) Vocoder Implementation using Python


The fundamental aim is to represent the speech signal with fewer required bits in speech coding
techniques.

You can find the report and code.

main.ipynb is source code, if you open it on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab you can see the plots and listen the speechs. To run the code, you must upload it Google Colab. 

Report.pdf is report.

In result folder, there are waveforms, speechs and example gain and voiced & unvoiced plot.
